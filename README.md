-Try Not to Die-
Noah Rausch, Nathan Cromwell


As gamers ourselves, we figured we would try our hands at creating one in Three.js.  We are happy with what we achieved, and think our game is pretty cool (although really hard to beat).  You simply move around using the keyboard, and have to collect all the glowing objects throughout the scene.  Seems easy, right?  The trick is not getting crushed to death by the moving pillars.  We tackled some interesting topics in graphics with this piece, from unit-collision and random spawning to lighting and bump-mapping.  Although we are happy with what we have, we have purposely designed it in a way which allows the addition of new features.  Who knows, maybe in the future we will add death-beams.
